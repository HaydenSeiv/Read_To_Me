# AI Audiobook Generator (Prototype)

This is a lightweight prototype for generating AI-narrated audiobooks from plain text files. The goal is to assist users who prefer listening over reading by transforming books they own into audio using multiple synthetic voices â€” one for each character and a narrator.
